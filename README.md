# ICSPy
Data Reduction, Evaluation and Management Software Library for the Institute of Crystallography and Structural Physics of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg

For now, please use the "setupinprogress" branch, till the library is more  or less working as intended.

Immediate ToDo s:

- Calibrate Module for Fit2D and pyFai (Fit2D is not necessary, but it is already implemented more or less)
- Universal Fit Module for XRR, XRD, SAS Data using a keyword specifier for identification
- Testcases for Calibration Module and Fit routines
- Testcase automation via some sort of managing program (Jenkins?)
